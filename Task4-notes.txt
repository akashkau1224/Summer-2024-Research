CodeAct

Code Act allows the LLM to create executable elements of code. This tool works on many different formats (SQL, Python, etc.)

LMQL

Uses partial querying and clever decoder tricks to optimize computer performance and latency when solving large problems.

AutoGen

Microsoft program that allows complex multi-agent interaction for LLMs.

DSPy

Optimization on using LLMs by seperating the flow of programs into modules from the specific parameters and weights, 
streamlining the whole process.

SWE Agents

Agent that fixes software issues directly in github repositories.

AutoCodeRover

Agent that offers automated code improvement using an abstract syntax tree model.

SGLang

Improves front-end interaction with the LLM and provides high performance through clever cache use.
